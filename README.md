# Author Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a Laravel-based Author Management System that allows users to add new authors via an AJAX-based form. The author data is validated and sent to a third-party API using an authentication token. The system ensures a smooth user experience with real-time error handling and form validation.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP**: 8.1+
- **Laravel**: 10.x
- **jQuery**: For AJAX requests
- **Bootstrap**: For UI styling (Optional)

Features

    List all authors with pagination.
    Add a new author using an AJAX request and store it via a third-party API.
    View details of an author, including their biography, gender, and books.
    Delete authors with a confirmation prompt.

2. Book Management

    Display a list of books associated with an author.
    Add a new book with fields like title, release date, description, ISBN, format, and number of pages.
    Handle errors returned by the API, including missing fields and incorrect data formats.
    Implement AJAX-based deletion of books.

3. Pagination & Sorting

    Implement pagination by fetching a limited number of records per request.
    Display total entries correctly in the table footer.
    Enable sorting of records by column headers.

4. Search with Debounce

    Implement a search bar with a debounce function to reduce API calls.
    Wait for the user to stop typing before making an API request.
